# Implementation of Sparse Distributed Memory using Spiking Neural Networks

The following files are used to implement different parts of CMMs and SDMs:

1. key_data_pairs.ipynb : Contains the code to generate key,data pairs which can be used as inputs to the SDM

2. LIF_Simulation.ipynb : Contains the code to simulate a Leaky integrate-and-fire spiking neural network

3. SNN_using_BindsNET.ipynb : Contains a demonstration of using BindsNet to create neural networks of spiking neurons

4. SDM_implementation.ipynb : Contains the complete code for implementing an N-of-M SDM and running simulations on it using BindsNET
